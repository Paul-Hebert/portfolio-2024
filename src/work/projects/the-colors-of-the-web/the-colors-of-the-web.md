title: The Colors of the Web
description: I was curious what colors were being used by large, popular sites, so I decided to find out. Alexa.com maintains a list of the most visited sites on the internet. I wrote a PHP script to scrape the ten most popular sites and record all the colors used in the sites' home pages and style sheets.

By displaying the colors used in popular sites in a variety of ways we can glean interesting conclusions about modern trends in web design. Organizing the colors by hue, saturation and value provides viewers with a variety of different ways to view the data. Instead of forcing conclusions upon the user this visualization provides them with the information they need to draw their own insights.

I scraped the data using PHP, then built the page using PHP, HTML, SCSS, and Javascript. This visualization was viewed by over 60,000 unique viewers and featured in dozens of publications including the
[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/09/14/can-you-guess-the-website-based-on-the-swatch-of-blue/),
[Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/popular-color-internet/),
[Adobe](https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/cool-or-just-common-blue-is-the-webs-most-popular-color/), and many more.
