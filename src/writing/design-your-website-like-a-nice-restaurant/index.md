I see the same argument play out over and over online: someone complains that all websites look the same and someone else says that’s a good thing since it makes them easier to use.

But it’s not all or nothing! Websites can be interesting and distinct while still being intuitive. Add some ambience!

My wife and I love going out to eat and exploring new restaurants. Some of our favorite restaurants look wildly different. Some have plants, paintings, or experimental light fixtures. They have different colors, furniture, and decorations. One has a pond. One has a rooftop bar. One has a full rickshaw inside!

The best of these restaurants have a distinct character that enhances your dining experience. When you walk in you can tell you’re in for a unique, fun, delicious time. While you’re waiting for your food there are interesting decorations to spark conversations. And after you leave you remember the experience.

But despite their differences, we always manage to find a table, order food, eat, go to the bathroom, and pay our bill.

All of these restaurants understand that certain things need to be consistent for an intuitive dining experience:

- The menu should be clear and easy to read.
- The restaurant layout should be easy to understand
- Things should be clearly labeled.
- Don’t get too experimental with the bathroom signs.
- The service should be quick.
- It should be accessible.
- Etc.

Websites work the same way. Follow common conventions to ensure they’re usable:

- The navigation should be clear and easy to read.
- The layout should be easy to understand
- Things should be clearly labeled.
- Don’t get too experimental with the links and buttons.
- The site should be quick.
- It should be accessible.
- Etc.

Be consistent where it matters. But don’t be afraid to show some character. Find a visual language that works for your brand. Add some fun illustrations. Experiment with colors. Find a nice font. Live a little.

I wouldn’t want all restaurants to look the same and I don’t want all websites to look the same.

Don’t settle for a bland, boring site in the name of usability. Take pride in your craft and build a site thats both intuitive and beautiful.

Do it tastefully. Don’t go over the top. But don’t be afraid to leave an impression.

Just make sure I can find the bathroom when I need it.
